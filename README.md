# Mass Assignment

## Objectives

1. Use keyword arguments to define an initialize method.
2. Use mass assignment to metaprogram an initialize method. 

## Instructions

* Create a Person class that accepts a hash upon initialization. The keys of the hash should conform to the attributes below: 

allowable properties: 
  
```ruby
:name, :birthday, :hair_color, :eye_color, :height, 
:weight, :handed, :complexion, :t_shirt_size, 
:wrist_size, :glove_size, :pant_length, :pant_width
```

  * Each key in the attributes hash will become a property of an initialized Person instance. So, you should make an `attr_accessor` for each of the above properties
  
  ex:

```ruby
bob_attributes = {name: "Bob", hair_color: "Brown"}

bob = Person.new(bob_attributes)
bob.name       # => "Bob"
bob.hair_color # => "Brown"

susan_attributes = {name: "Susan", height: "5'11\"", eye_color: "Green"}

susan = Person.new(susan_attributes)
susan.name      # => "Susan"
susan.height    # => "5'11""
susan.eye_color # => "Green"
```

* Your initialize method should use iteration and the `.send` method to mass assign the value of each key/value pair to its associated key (i.e. method). Refer to the previous reading to help you solve this one.
